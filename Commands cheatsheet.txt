##### 1. Cluster commands ##### 
# DGX-1:
sxm2sh -X

# POWER9:
p9sh

= enter the designated cluster

lscpu
= view cpu data

free
= view memory use

nvidia-smi 
= view nvidia setup

nvidia-smi topo -m 
= view topology

nvprof ./a.out
= run a profiler on executable performance

 

##### 2. Git commands ##### 
git clone ..url.. clones to wd
also clone from https url
URL WORKS FINE:
git clone https://github.com/simonaertssen/CodingWork.git


but ssh/id automates the id (look at private/public keys on the computer?) 
-> look at GitHub/settings/ssh

Download single files?
Maybe look at deleting files?
use nano filename.extension for quick edits

then:
git clone ..

(touch was really cool)

git add -A (to add ALL the new file I guess?) 
or
git add addme.c

git commit -m “This is the description“

git push

git pull (for a cloned repository)
